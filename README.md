# Basic-Linux-Shell (Job Spooler)
The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with low-level Unix/POSIX system
calls related to processes, signal handling, files, and I/O redirection.
You will implement a job spooler program, called jobber, that accepts user
requests to spool tasks for execution, cancel jobs, pause and resume jobs,
show the status of jobs, and expunge terminated jobs from the system.


## Takeaways
This project involves:

• Process execution: forking, executing, and reaping.


• Signal handling.


• Use of "dup" to perform I/O redirection.


• Advanced usage of Unix commands and the command line.


• Usage of C libraries and system calls.
